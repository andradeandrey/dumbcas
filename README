Simple Content-Addressed-Datastore.

In the likes of camlistore but really, really simple.

The idea is that you can rsync the data around without problem. To be used as a
backup solution that is faster than raw rsync (supports file rename/move
efficiently) but permits deleting old backups unlike bup.
